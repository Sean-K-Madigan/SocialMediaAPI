  ## Project Description
  
  The goal of this project was to develop a finctional API for a startup Social Media company. They needed the ability to create a user database that stored users, friends, thoughts, and reactions. This database was to be a NoSQL database to enchance flexibility and scalability. The problem solved was that the company is now able to track and save users and their thoughts and reactions. I learned how to build a NoSQL database from scratch and improved my debugging skills.
